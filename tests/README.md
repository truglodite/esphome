# Tests for ESPHome

This directory contains some tests for ESPHome.
At the moment, all the tests only work by simply executing
`esphome` over some YAML files that are made to test
whether the yaml gets converted to the proper C++ code.

Of course this is all just very high-level and things like
unit tests would be much better. So if you have time and know
how to set up a unit testing framework for python, please do
give it a try.
